  <p>How Dorsey started Twitter</p>
<p> When Dorsey moved to New York, for hacking into one of New York's International dispatch stations, texting wasn't a big thing, so he wanted to create an app that let him contact his family and friend back from St. Louis.  That's when he invented Twitter.  He said in his interview, that if you went to his Mom's twitter, you would see the tweetes of her yelling at Dorsey's little brother, because to them Twitter was just a little app that helped them get in touch with each other. After putting a ton of time and and effort him and his teem had put into Twitter, it had started to take off, and moe and more people were using it. When Dorsey had first started Twitter, it was to stay close with friends and family back at home, so now that others are using it, Dorsey still explains Twitter as a way for a person to feel like their with loved ones without really being there in person.  </p>

  <p>How Dorsey started Square</p>
</div>
 <p> Recently Dorsey came out with a new piece of technology, called Square.  Once Twitter was booming, and plenty of people were using it, Dorsey wanted to start something new, he just couldn't decide what.  One of Dorsey's close friends is in business where he needs to sell things.  One day Dorsey's friend came to him and siad that he had to turn down a sale that day, because he didn't have a credit car machine on him.  Well, that hit a light in Dorsey, to make a portable Credit card machine that can be used on smartphones.  Once Dorsey got his team together, they started working to make an app, and an actual piece of technology.  Dorsey said that naming the app is one of the hardest parts of the app making process for him and hi team, he said that the name has to have somewhat of a relationship with the app, and it has to make sense.  Well, after long thought out hours, they thought of a name, "Square", this is not only because of it's shape, because it can also fit in your pocket.  To sum it up, Square is a piece of technology that accepts Credit Cards through your phone, for small companies like his friend's.   </p>

  <h1>Dispatch</h1>
  <p>How Dorsey started dispatch</p>
	<p> Ever since Dorsey was a young child he was interested in computers, and technology.  He grew up in St. Louis, next to a railroad track, and he loved waiting for them and watching them ride past his house.  By the time he was thirteen years old, he had gotten his own police box for his Birthday.  He programed it to alert him when Police cars, Ambulances, and anything else Police related was coming near his house, so he could look for them.  After telling people that he knew when the police were coming near him, someone told him, that he was operating disbatch.  He had always wanted to leave hi small town and see what other technology was ut there that he had not yet heard about.  After weeks, and months of hacking into one of New York's international Disbatch stations, he finally found a direct email that he could email.  After about a week of two, he had convinced them to fly him out to New York City, so he could show them what he had done, and that is where it all began.
